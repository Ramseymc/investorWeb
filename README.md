${code}
----------
  Problem to fix -> building the update values from the form to the route, as they currently aren't displaying 

  Try this -> run the update and try with two form value formAppnd values, and two different vtextfields ,
  one with selectedInvestor[0].investor_id_number, 
  one with investorId 
    which is set after the getinvestorr details call in the mounted method


-------
other to dos: 
---
  get the investorid in create investment to show his investor_code and investor_name at the top 

---
  build a way to display the uploaded files
  fix the file renaming system - debug why the filenames arent going through, on createInvestor
